### Project Description
WE HAD IMPLEMENTED A MACHINE RELATED TO MEDICAL FIELD FOR REDUCING THE MISUSE/MISLEADING DUE TO THE OVER CONCUSMITION OF SCHEDULED MEDICINE.THE MACHINE RESEMBLES A VENDING MACHINE WHICH WILL STORE SCHEDULED MEDICINES. THE MACHINE IS LINKED WITH THE APP WHICH IS AVAILABLE TO BOTH DOCTORS AND PATIENTS. THE APP WILL PROVIDE A DIGITAL PRESCRIPTION FOR TAKING SCHEDULED MEDICINE. AFTER, WITH THE HELP OF THE DIGITAL PRESCRIPTION ONLY THE MEDICINE WILL DISPATCH FROM THE VENDING MACHINE.

### The Problem statement
MISUSE OR OVERCONSUMPTION OF SCHEDULED MEDICINES MAY LEAD TO SEVERAL ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS DRUG DEALING,BLACK MARKETING,MENTAL ABUSE,SUCIDIE ATTEMPTS,MURDER ATTEMPTS AND ETC... .

### The Solution
WE HAD FOUND A MACHINE RESEMBLES A VENDING MACHINE WHICH WILL STORE SCHEDULED MEDICINES. THE MACHINE IS LINKED WITH THE APP WHICH IS AVAILABLE TO BOTH DOCTORS AND PATIENTS. THE APP WILL PROVIDE A DIGITAL PRESCRIPTION FOR TAKING SCHEDULED MEDICINE. AFTER, WITH THE HELP OF THE DIGITAL PRESCRIPTION ONLY THE MEDICINE WILL DISPATCH FROM THE VENDING MACHINE.
THE VENDING MACHINE WILL STORE MEDICINE ACCORDING TO THE ALPHABETICAL ORDER AND WILL BE RELEASED WITH RESPECT TO THE DOCTOR'S DIGITAL PRESCRIPTION.
FOR THE DIGITAL PRESCRIPTION WE HAD DESIGNED AN APPLICATION WHICH IS AVAILABLE ON BOTH PLAY STORE AND APP STORE. IN THIS APP THERE WILL BE TWO LOGIN.FIRST ONE WILL BE FOR DOCTORS AND THE NEXT ONE WILL BE FOR THE PATIENTS.ONLY DOCTORS CAN USE THE APP FOR PRESCRIBING MEDICINE.THE DOCTOR WILL BE VERIFIED WITH THE HELP OF LICENCE WHICH ISSUED BY THE RESPECTED AUTHORITIES.THE PATIENT CAN VIEW THE PRESCRIPTION WITH THE HELP OF THIS APP. THIS WILL BE SCANNED IN VENDING MACHINE FOR DISPATCHING SCHEDULED MEDICINE.

THIS IS THE LOGIN PAGE OF OUR APP WHICH CONTAINS USERNAME AND PASSWORD.THERE IS ALSO AN OPTION FOR NEW USERS FOR REGISTERING.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9337612-6511-40af-ba87-368b13d2276f)
THIS IS THE NEXT PAGE AFTER THE LOGIN HAS BEEN COMPLETELY SUCCESSFUL. HERE THE DOCTOR IS ALLOWED TO WRITE THE PRESCRIPTION FOR THE SCHEDULED MEDICINE FOR THE PATIENT.IN THIS PAGE THE DOCTOR CAN ALSO EDIT,DELETE,UPADTE ACCORDING TO THE REQUIREMENT.

THIS IS THE PAGE WHERE THE PATIENT CAN SAW THE PRESCRIPTION AND HISTORY OF MEDICINE.



# Diagrams
![Workflow](Add your workflow/architecture diagram here)
FIRST OF ALL THE PATIENT HAS TO VISIT THE DOCTOR THEN THE DOCTOR HAS TO PRESCRIBE THE SCHEDULED MEDICINE IN THE APP WHICH IS DEVELOPED BY US. THEN THE PATIENT HAS TO GO THE PHARMACY WHERE YOU CAN BUY THE SCHEDULED MEDICINE WITH THE HELP OF APPLICAATION AND THE VENDING MACHINE.THE APPLICATION WILL BE THE FIRST THING TO WORK BECAUSE WITH THE HELP OF APPLICATION ONLY THE VENDING MACHINE WORKS.AFTER SCANNING THE DIGITAL PRESCRIPTION WITH THE HELP OF SCANNER PROVIDED BY THE VENDING MACHINE THE BACKGROUNG PROGRAMMING OR CODE WHICH IS SET TO BE WILL CHECK WHETHER THE MEDICINE IS AVAILABLE OR NOT. AFTER THE CHECKING PROCESS THE VENDING MACHINE WILL DISPATCH THE MEDICINE IF THE MEDICINE IS AVAILABLE. OTHERWISE IT WILL PROVIDE SUITABLE ERROR MESSAGES TO THE MONITOR WHICH IS PROVIDED ON THE VENDING MACHINE.THEN WITH THE HELP OF THE PERSON THE MEDICINE WILL BE HAND OVER TO THE PATIENTS.
